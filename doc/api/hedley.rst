The `common` module embeds Hedley, a single C/C++ header you can include in your
project to enable compiler-specific features while retaining compatibility with
all compilers. 

It complements the ASAP common helpers with dozens of macros to help make your 
code easier to use, harder to misuse, safer, faster, and more portable.
